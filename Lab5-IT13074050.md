###Why Softlogic needs an Information Security Management System? ###
Softlogic is a multinational Computer technology company which holds large amount of information. Softlogic provides some services because of that it has severs. So those information should have been protected by well define manner. As a business company needs a legal obligation under the Data Protection Act.
The ISO 27001 standard is designed to ensure that adequate and proportionate security controls are put in place to ensure Data Protection and protect sensitive company information and data in order to comply with Data Protection laws and also to gain customer confidence.

 
###Benefits of implementing an Information Security Management System based on ISO/IEC 27000 series standards (ISO27k)###

Every asset in every organization must be protected and information is an asset which must be protected as well. During the evolution of human race the value of information is growing constantly. The higher the value of information the more effectively it must be protected. There are a lot of schemes and mechanisms for information protection. One of the most popular systems that help organizations to establish information security is the ISMS defined by ISO 27000 standards. The benefits of implementing ISMS in this case seem obvious.
The ISMS is a system which drives the management of Information, regulates the information flows and builds an environment for information protection. The ISMS is not a single document or even a single process, it is a set of well-organized processes and documents. All the benefits of implementing ISMS derive from those well-organized processes and documentation.
Well organized ISMS help organizations to identify the assets subject to risks, evaluate and manage these risks in a proper manner, monitor the implemented controls. First of all management should define the scope of ISMS considering the type of the business and the mission of the company, the information assets and the technological infrastructure. The integral part of each ISMS is the Information Security Risk management. It can be either a process separated from the Organization’s overall risk management or integrated in it. The phases of risk management methodology of ISMS are similar to other standards: Risk Identification, Risk assessment and Risk treatment.

####By implementing ISMS the organizations can gain:####

• Prevention of security breaches: Implementation of controls designed by ISMS helps organizations to identify the vulnerabilities and security threats and prevent the security breaches.

• Prevention of unauthorized access of critical information: The ISMS establishes the classification of information assets and authorization for accessing classified assets.

• Competitiveness: The established ISMS adds to the value of organization as comprehensive operational guidelines and procedures of information security management system prevent security breaches and subsequent waste of resources and loss of clients’ trust thus providing the organization with competitive advantage over competitors.

• Management commitment to the information security: The ISMS makes the 
management pay more attention to the information security risks and issues.

• Public recognition of its security benchmark: Organizations can benchmark their achievement in ISMS and gain public recognition.
